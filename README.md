# Lets Habit (WIP)
Yet another habit tracker, but it recommend you to form habits with your friends.
Most habit tracker track your habits by yourself, it can be hard and require a lot of discipline to form a habit, and sometimes it feel bored. 
But with the help and supervision of our friends, I think we better to form a habit even with joy and fun.

# Why this project
I used some habit tracker tools, like [life of discipline](https://www.lifeofdiscipline.com), [xiao ri chang(小日常)](https://apps.apple.com/cn/app/%E5%B0%8F%E6%97%A5%E5%B8%B8-%E5%AD%A6%E4%B9%A0%E8%AE%A1%E5%88%92%E4%B8%8E%E6%97%B6%E9%97%B4%E7%AE%A1%E7%90%86%E6%97%A5%E5%8E%86/id1263789061), etc.
These are good tools to track and form habits, but each one of them lack some of my desired features. So, I want to build a habit tracker which has all the feature I wanted and also free of charge and full open source.

In addition, I always wanted to start a side project, and this is my first side project. May be it's not a idea which can bring a profit for me, but I hope it will be a idea I can found some joy and challenge here.


# My desired features besides a basic habit tracker 
- [ ] Track a habit with your friends (**The main Feature I want to build**, to form a habit with friends as a group, all of you in this group checked the habit today, then the habit is considered as checked)
- [ ] Check time delay (I am a guy who often go to sleep after 0:00 AM, and I will check my habits before going to bed. As most of the habit tracker take 0:00 AM as the deadline, I usually has to complete the check of "yestarday", which makes me feel annoyed. If the deadline is set up to 2:00 AM or 3:00 AM, I can check all my habits of "today". I think this will be a good feature for the people who often stay up late.)
- [ ] ...
